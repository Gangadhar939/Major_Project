# CS HUB
Main aim of the project is to develop a departmental website portal for Computer Science 
Department where all details and updates of the department is presented. Instead of communicating 
through social media like WhatsApp and Telegram, this portal gives all updates to Students and 
faculty. 
As everyone has access to this website no student can miss any updates. In this portal there 
will be availability of curriculums, timetables, faculty details, student details and all subjects 
related materials and placement related resources etc. The admin has control over all activities in 
the portal. HOD and faculty has their own privileges to particular activities
